Pys√§kkikummi is a project started at [dev4transport](http://forumvirium.fi/tapahtuma/dev4transport-4-5102013). The goal of this project is to allow people to "adopt" HSL's public transport stops and to report when there are issues with the stop.

Issue reports can be sent to the city using Helsinki's [open311](http://open311.org/) API.
